# Global-Conflict-and-Policy-Sentiment-Analysis-Platform-

Description of the app: 

Name: Global Conflict and Policy Sentiment Analysis Platform 

The purpose of this app is to predict conflict risks in different countries based on economic, political and social indicators. It will also analyze global sentiment on relevant policies to those countries (e.g. trade, climate change and foreign intervention) from social media and news sources. By connecting these two areas, the app will allow users to see how  government policies contribute to or mitigate conflict risks in different regions. 

 

Features of the app: 

1. Conflict risk prediction:  

This will use machine learning to predict the likelihood of conflicts (civil wars, international disputes), based on socio-economic indicators (unemployment, GDP, political instability, death rates based from these factors) and historical data. 


2. Global Policy Sentiment analysis 

Use NLP to analyze public opinion on global policies (like trade agreements or passed UN resolutions) from news articles and social media.


3. Combined insights 

This will correlate the risk predictions with the sentiment analysis of policies to identify patterns (e.g. negative sentiment on economic policies correlating with increased conflict risk in certain regions) 


4. Visualization (main thing that will be visible to user and represent the data) 

This will provide visualization that allows users to explore the conflict risks and public sentiment on a color-coded map interface (It will be color-coded by conflict risk), with sentiment scores on top.
